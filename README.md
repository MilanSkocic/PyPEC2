# PyPEC

Fitting PEC data with an graphical interface. The code was developped in Python 2.7 during my PhD from 2012 to 2015. The documentation is incompleted and the code is no more under active development. 

This repository is only used as backup for the code. A new version in Python 3.X was developed at the end of my PhD and is still under development.
